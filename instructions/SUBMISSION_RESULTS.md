## 📈 **Error Distribution Analysis**

- **39.7%** of cases have **≤$25 error** (Excellent/Very Good)
- **69.1%** of cases have **≤$50 error** (Good or better)
- **87.4%** of cases have **≤$100 error** (Acceptable or better)
- Only **12.6%** of cases have **>$100 error**

## 🔬 **Simplified Technical Approach**

### **Phase 1: Data Analysis & Pattern Discovery**
We analyzed 1,000 historical cases and interviewed 5 employees to understand the system behavior. Statistical analysis revealed key patterns like mileage tiers, receipt thresholds, and duration effects.

### **Phase 2: Machine Learning Model**
Built a **Random Forest model** with 22 engineered features based on discovered patterns:
- Basic inputs: days, miles, receipts
- Derived features: efficiency ratios, receipt-to-mile ratios, duration categories
- Interaction terms: combinations that trigger bonuses/penalties

### **Phase 3: Business Rule Integration**
Added specific penalty adjustments for edge cases discovered through outlier analysis:
- Extreme receipt-to-mile ratio penalties
- 8-day trip adjustments
- Same-day extreme travel penalties
- Receipt ending bug (.49/.99 penalty)

### **Final Implementation**
Combined ML predictions with targeted business rule adjustments, achieving 97.9% variance explained.

##  **Business Rules Discovered**

### **Inferred Core Business Rules**

#### **1. Mileage Tier System**
- **First 100 miles**: Higher rate (~$0.58/mile)
- **Miles 100+**: Lower rate (~$0.25/mile)
- **Source**: Confirmed by Lisa (Accounting) and statistical analysis

#### **2. Duration Sweet Spots**
- **4-6 day trips**: Get preferential treatment
- **Optimal**: 5-day trips often receive bonuses
- **Source**: Confirmed by Marcus (Sales), Jennifer (HR), and Kevin (Procurement)

#### **3. Receipt Amount Thresholds**
- **Primary threshold**: ~$828 (major decision point)
- **Small receipt penalty**: Amounts <$50 often penalized
- **Diminishing returns**: High receipts (>$1500) get reduced rates
- **Source**: Confirmed by Lisa (Accounting) and Dave (Marketing)

#### **4. Receipt Ending Bug**
- **Penalty for .49/.99 endings**: 25% reduction in reimbursement
- **System bug**: Appears to be unintentional but consistent
- **Source**: Confirmed by Lisa (Accounting) and Marcus (Sales) theories

#### **5. Efficiency Bonuses**
- **High miles-per-day**: Gets bonus treatment
- **Optimal range**: Varies by trip length and other factors
- **Penalty**: Very low efficiency (<30 mi/day) penalized
- **Source**: Confirmed by Kevin (Procurement) and Marcus (Sales)

#### **6. Trip Length Penalties**
- **8-day trips**: Moderate penalties for high expense ratios
- **Long trips (10+ days)**: Reduced per-day rates
- **Same-day extreme**: Penalties for >800 miles in one day
- **Source**: Partially confirmed by Kevin's "vacation penalty" theory

### **✅ Advanced Pattern Discovery**

#### **7. Receipt-to-Mile Ratio Analysis**
- **High ratios (>10)**: Often indicate special trip types
- **Extreme ratios (>25)**: May trigger penalty mechanisms
- **City travel pattern**: High receipts + low miles handled specially

#### **8. Complex Interaction Effects**
- **Duration × Efficiency**: Optimal combinations trigger bonuses
- **Receipts × Trip Length**: Spending limits vary by trip duration
- **Multiple thresholds**: System uses multiple decision points

#### **9. Outlier Handling**
- **Extreme cases**: Special rules for unusual trip patterns
- **Edge case penalties**: Specific adjustments for problematic combinations
- **Business rule caps**: Maximum reimbursement limits by trip length
